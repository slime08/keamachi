          # Personal Access Token (PAT) is usually not needed if using GITHUB_TOKEN for organization repos or if pages is public
          # For public repositories, GITHUB_TOKEN typically has sufficient permissions.
          # For private repositories or specific permissions, a PAT might be required.
          # If deployment fails, check your GitHub Pages settings and repository permissions.

# Instructions for GitHub Pages setup:
# 1. In your GitHub repository settings, go to "Pages" section.
# 2. Under "Source", select "Deploy from a branch".
# 3. Choose "gh-pages" branch and "/ (root)" folder, then click "Save".
# 4. Ensure your repository has "GitHub Actions" enabled (usually default).
# 5. If you have a custom domain, uncomment the 'cname' line above and set it.
